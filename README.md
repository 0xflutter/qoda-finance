Rewards for participation in Qoda Challenges
When checking references to tasks, check rules, multiple accounts, etc. We noticed repeated attempts to overcome it. That's why we've decided to make the distribution fair and reward only those who truly complete the maximum number of missions carefully. Top 300 participants according to the leaderboard. The snapshot will be taken after the program ends and additional checks of the presentations and attendees for possible violations of the rules.

The distribution of prizes among the winners will be made according to the prize table:
