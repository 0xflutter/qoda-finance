Borrow and lend on your terms. Marketplace exchange for loans, built on Moonbeam.

 mission is to bring a complete fixed income solution to the DeFi world. Qoda enables collateralized borrowing and lending of crypto assets at fixed interest rates for fixed periods, where terms are set by the users themselves.

Qoda launch on Moonriver is currently scheduled for January 2023. Any changes to this launch date will be announced separately if needed.

QODEX Token ve Tokenomics
The token code is QODEX. The total coin supply is 10 million coins. This will be a fair launch with no token sales. TGE will start when contracts are live and then the tokens will be available on the network and will be distributed as follows: 5% will go to the treasury and the remaining 95% is the community portion.

In detail, the community part will be distributed as follows:

Please note that the numbers provided are currently not finalized and the distribution may change as we continue to work on tokenomics.

Rewards for participation in Qoda Challenges
When checking references to tasks, check rules, multiple accounts, etc. We noticed repeated attempts to overcome it. That's why we've decided to make the distribution fair and reward only those who truly complete the maximum number of missions carefully. Top 300 participants according to the leaderboard. The snapshot will be taken after the program ends and additional checks of the presentations and attendees for possible violations of the rules.

The distribution of prizes among the winners will be made according to the prize table:

But that's not all. Not everyone has the time to participate in the program for various reasons, or is aware of the content, graphics, etc. We understand that it cannot. Therefore, we will distribute the 20,000 QODEX reward funds equally to 100 testnet users. We'll explain later what you can do to get the rewards.

Testnet-related activities will continue until the launch on Moonriver. The list of 100 addresses that will receive the award will be published before the launch on Moonriver.

Additionally, each winner of past and future competitions will receive 200 QODEX tokens.

If a participant wins all three activities, they will receive all 3 prizes.
